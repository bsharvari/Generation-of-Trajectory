# Generation-of-Trajectory
Generating intermediate frames for a trajectory

Run the Project1_Final.m file to generate the co-ordinates of the tool tip for the intermediate frames. The file takes robot.key and object.key as inputs. It then generates the robot.ang and object.traj files.
Use the animate program to visualize the trajectory of the manipulator.
